# hello-world
My first project

This project is the same as alot of other people also have done. Why does not the world answer back when I say: "Hello world!"
Is it not polite to answere hello back? I am just saying, it would be nice.

## Is this a heading 2?
  * And this a list?
  * Point 2
  * Point 3
